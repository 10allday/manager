### Features

* **modules:** add catalog price as an independant module ([e464422](https://github.com/ovh/manager/commit/e46442241e7d2402b8d7c97838cc12d65f3ad1d1))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **modules:** This component is just the export of the one located in web/app/components/manager-order-catalog-price.
The web located component should be replaced by the new one (refactor will be done once this module is released)
