### Bug Fixes

* **deps:** use latest for @ovh-ux/manager-core ([#2394](https://github.com/ovh/manager/issues/2394)) ([fd0a25b](https://github.com/ovh/manager/commit/fd0a25b11bd5119649daf3b1605bb56bf70f3ff9))



# [1.0.0](https://github.com/ovh/manager/compare/@ovh-ux/manager-catalog-price@0.0.0...@ovh-ux/manager-catalog-price@1.0.0) (2020-03-04)


### Features

* **modules:** add catalog price as an independant module ([e464422](https://github.com/ovh/manager/commit/e46442241e7d2402b8d7c97838cc12d65f3ad1d1))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **modules:** This component is just the export of the one located in web/app/components/manager-order-catalog-price.
The web located component should be replaced by the new one (refactor will be done once this module is released)
